## Python files

It's a complete mess and I wrote them just to test the features.

[ssd_led.py](ssd_led.py) is not needed because rpi has this feature on it's owm.

[encoder.py](encoder.py) navigates up, down and push is for enter.

[__init__.py](__init__.py) is only used for the power switch at the moment.

[mr3000service.service](mr3000service.service) file doesn't work.
